# Getting started: from the Omarchy menu to TestFlight

This guide takes a new user from a fresh Omarchy install to an app build in
TestFlight. Each step names the command to run and what you should see. The
README has the details and FINDINGS.md has the reasons.

What you need:

- Omarchy on Apple Silicon or x86_64.
- A free Apple ID, to download Xcode once (no Mac needed).
- For TestFlight: a paid Apple Developer account and an App Store Connect API key.
- For device runs: an iPhone and a USB data cable.

## 1. Install the toolchain

1. Open the Omarchy menu and select **Install > Development > iOS (Swift + xtool)**.
   From a terminal, `omarchy-install-dev-env ios` does the same thing.
2. The installer installs Swift and builds xtool from source (about 7 minutes
   on a 16-core x86_64 machine, about 11 minutes on an M1).
3. The installer then stops at the SDK step and prints a download link. Sign in
   with your Apple ID and download the Xcode `.xip` that it names (Xcode 27 for
   Swift 6.4).
4. Run the installer again with the download:

   ```
   XCODE_XIP=~/Downloads/Xcode_27.0.xip ~/.local/share/omarchy-apple-dev/install-toolchain.sh
   ```

5. This run registers the SDK and builds the Swift macro server (about 5
   more minutes). Check the result: `swift sdk list` prints `darwin`. The Install row in the
   menu is now dimmed and **Remove > Development > iOS** is shown.

No sudo? Clone the repo and run `./install-toolchain.sh --user-only` with a
swift.org toolchain on PATH (README, "Install"). An admin must first install
`base-devel git libimobiledevice openssl zip`.

## 2. Build an app

A new app:

```
xtool new MyApp
cd MyApp
xtool dev build
```

You should see `Build complete!` and `xtool/MyApp.app`.

An existing Xcode project:

```
python3 ~/.local/share/omarchy-apple-dev/tools/xcodeproj2xtool.py MyApp.xcodeproj
cd omarchy-xtool
ulimit -n 65536
xtool dev build
```

The generator writes the xtool adapter next to the project. It prints one
`warning:` line for each thing it cannot convert, for example storyboards
(Linux has no Interface Builder compiler). Read those lines before you
continue.

To edit the code, open the folder of the `.xcodeproj` (or `omarchy-xtool`) in
any editor with SourceKit-LSP, for example VS Code with the Swift extension or
Neovim. The generator writes `.bsp/xtool.json` next to the project, and
`xtool dev build` writes one in `omarchy-xtool`. The editor then gets
diagnostics, completion, hover and go to definition across the app, its
frameworks, the iOS SDK and package dependencies. The first open indexes the
whole project; cross-file results appear when that ends.

## 3. Run it on your iPhone

1. Run `xtool auth` once and sign in with your Apple ID.
2. Plug in the iPhone and tap **Trust**.
3. Run `~/.local/share/omarchy-apple-dev/device-run.sh` from the project
   directory. It installs and starts the app. For LLDB, follow FINDINGS.md 56.

## 4. Upload to TestFlight

Do this setup once:

1. In App Store Connect, go to Users and Access > Integrations and create a
   team API key with the App Manager role. Download the `.p8` file and keep it
   in a private directory, for example `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/`.
2. Note the Key ID and the Issuer ID from the same page.
3. Create the app record (Apps > + > New App) with your bundle ID. The API
   cannot create apps.

Then, from the project directory:

```
ASC_KEY_PATH=~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 \
ASC_ISSUER_ID=<issuer id> ASC_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX \
  ~/.local/share/omarchy-apple-dev/ship.sh --upload
```

`ship.sh` builds a release `.app` and compiles the app icon. It creates your
Apple Distribution certificate and an App Store profile on the first run. It
then signs the app and checks it offline, and any `FAIL` stops it. Last, it
uploads the `.ipa` and prints Apple's processing result. When the result is
`COMPLETE`, the build appears in TestFlight after Apple's processing. `ship.sh`
never submits a build for review.

This path is proven: a demo app and NetNewsWire, with its widget and share
extensions, were built, signed and uploaded this way on Linux, and both are
`VALID` in App Store Connect (FINDINGS.md items 38 and 40).

## 5. A Mac app

For a SwiftPM package with one executable product (a SwiftUI or AppKit app),
from the package directory:

```
ASC_KEY_PATH=~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 \
ASC_ISSUER_ID=<issuer id> ASC_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXX BUNDLE_ID=com.example.MyMacApp \
  ~/.local/share/omarchy-apple-dev/ship-mac.sh --notarize
```

It builds `build/MyMacApp.app`, signs it with your Developer ID Application
certificate, and notarizes it, so it opens on any Mac. Only the Account Holder
can create that certificate, in the developer portal: upload a CSR, and put the
key and the certificate as `key.pem` and `cert.pem` in
`~/.config/omarchy-apple-dev/developer-id/`. Without `--notarize` and without
the certificate, the app is signed ad hoc and opens only on your own Macs.
FINDINGS.md item 57 has the details.

## If something fails

- `Too many open files`: run `ulimit -n 65536` first.
- After a Swift toolchain swap (mise, asdf), run `install-toolchain.sh --repair`.
- Search FINDINGS.md for the exact error text. Most of the errors met so far
  are listed there with their cause and fix.
